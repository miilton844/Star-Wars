# Star wars project

This is a  project challenge. In this project I have built a website where a user can choose and select is favorite star wars movie. There are 2 sections - table contents and movie details. The project was built with React and Typescript. The data is fetched from the Star Wars API: SWAPI https://swapi.dev
