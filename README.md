# Star wars project

Deployment : https://star-wars-zoomin.herokuapp.com/

Please notice that the app might be asleep - so dont panic :) and try to launch again if it doesnt launch at the first time.

This is a  project challenge. In this project I have built a website where a user can choose and select is favorite star wars movie. There are 2 sections - table contents and movie details. The project was built with React and Typescript. The data is fetched from the Star Wars API: SWAPI https://swapi.dev
