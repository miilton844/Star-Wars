# Star wars project

Deployment : https://star-wars-favorite-films.herokuapp.com/

Please notice that the deployed app might be asleep, so the first time you try to launch it will probably hang up. Dont panic!!!! :), this is an expected behaviour of the app due to it being served in a freemium model. Please try to launch again after some seconds.

This is a  project challenge. In this project I have built a website where a user can choose and select his/her favorite star wars movie. There are 2 sections - table contents and movie details. The project was built with React and Typescript. The data is fetched from the Star Wars API: SWAPI https://swapi.dev
